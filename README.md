# XRF_analysis
Data processing for XRF analysis project

## Data

The data is kept as SQL databases because this is quicker to load than any csv or MS Excel files and so allows for ease 
of access. This uses the SQLite3 library built into Python which is pretty intuitive but there is a code attached 
(to_csv_data.py) which is able to convert the data into csv files if this is more convenient.

## Starting Analysis

This code contains some simple plotting procedures and is not massively interesting going forward.
